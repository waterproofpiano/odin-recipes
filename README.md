This is a super original recipe website that I will use to curate some of the finest recipes in the world.

I am a picky eater, so they will be recipes I can turn to when I encounter the dreaded "what do you want for dinner?" question.

Keep in mind that I am a picky eater of texture and temperature, but like most tastes.  This will be beneficial for those who typically do not like things such as cold pasta, most salads, iceberg lettuce (waste of time), and potato salad.
